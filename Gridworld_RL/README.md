# Assignment: Solving a 3D Gridworld Problem using MDP & RL 

This project implements a Q-Learning agent to find the optimal policy in a 3D grid world environment as described in the assignment.

* **Dependencies:** This project is implemented in Python 3 and requires the following libraries  
1. Numpy  
2. Matplotlib  
3. tqdm

	Install them using pip:  
		‘Pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm’

* **How to Run**  
  * Ensure you have a Jupyter Notebook installed.  
  * Place the ‘Gridworld_Assignment.ipynb’ file in a directory.  
  * Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open the file.  
  * You can run all cells sequentially by clicking ‘Cell > Run All’ in the toolbar.

* **Project Files:**  
  * Gridworld_Assignment.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the environment implementation, Q-learning algorithms, experiments and visualizations.  
  * Report.pdf: The project report detailing the MDP formulation, methods, results and analysis.  
  * Readme.pdf: This file.  
      
* **Reproducibility:**  
  * The random seed for obstacle placement and other stochastic elements has been fixed to ensure that the results and visualizations are reproducible. The seed is set at the beginning of the notebook.
